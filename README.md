**IdeaNest** is a minimalistic note-taking platform inspired by Notion, designed for fast idea capture, structured knowledge organization, and distraction-free writing.
It blends a handwritten aesthetic with a clean, modern interface to create a cozy, personal writing environment.

The application is built using **React + TypeScript** on the frontend and **Supabase** as the backend, providing authentication, storage, and real-time database updates.
Users can create pages, add content blocks, upload cover images, and organize their thoughts intuitively.



##  Uniqueness

IdeaNest distinguishes itself through its **paper-like interface with a warm, analog feel**, while still offering the flexibility of a digital editor.

Unlike typical note apps that feel corporate or sterile, IdeaNest’s goal is to:

- Make writing feel natural, inviting, and cozy
- Reduce friction for capturing spontaneous thoughts
- Provide a structure similar to Notion but with an artful, calming design
- Encourage creative flow rather than rigid documentation
 
It merges **digital productivity** with **handwritten personality**, creating a workspace that feels personal and enjoyable.
